# MasterMind (kind of)

a variant of master mind with numbers. 

no UI, only console app. 

the number length can vary 3-9

written in dotnet core 3.1 on linux



possible improvements:

* number length as argument (now hardcoded)
* UI 
* translation to English (now German)
* more unit tests (there are never enough!)
* and of course COMMENTS
